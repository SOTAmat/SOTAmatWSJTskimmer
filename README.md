# SOTAmatWSJTskimmer

A WSJT-X Plugin that filters reception reports and forwards potential SOTAmat messages to the SOTAmat server

You can use Visual Studio to build the code.
To publish all platforms, use a command line tool and the "Publish-All_Platforms.BAT" file on Windows. It will create the executables in a "Publish" folder.
